1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be preferred when working on a team project, or when two more devices / machines are involved in the development of a project. Remote repositories are helpful when you want a backup of an important project of yours.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

GitHub is a collaborative platform and each repository may have a number of contributors directly affecting the repository in some way. One may or may not want to automatically add those changes into their local repo, so it makes sense to always pull changes manually whenever the need might arise.
