1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A '.git' directory gets added as soon as a repository is initialized. A repository is the collection of files which we want Git to keep track of.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

We aim for 'one commit per logical change.' We should commit relevant files together. Staging area bridges the gap between working directory and the repository providing more control to the users.
