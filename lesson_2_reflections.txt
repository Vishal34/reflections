1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A '.git' directory gets added as soon as a repository is initialized. A repository is the collection of files which we want Git to keep track of.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

We aim for 'one commit per logical change.' We should commit relevant files together. Staging area bridges the gap between working directory and the repository providing more control to the users.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We commit only those files in the staging area which go together in the Git repository logically, and the rest of the files in staging area remain the same. We use 'git add <filename>' to add the file into the staging area. And then we do a 'git commit' to commit those changes into the Git repository and add a commit message to it.
